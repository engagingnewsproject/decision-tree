Iframe Explanation - Why is there an iframe inside the iframe?
===============================================================

Short Answer: The `<php>` handlebars template is only rendered when needed, rather than on every load.

Further Explanation
---------------------
Originally, the whole `<php>` handlebars template was output inside the `<noscript>` tags, but this means that the server had to run all those scripts, even if it wasn't in use. By putting it in an `<iframe>`, the server will only process the handlebars templates with `<php>` if a direct call to that url is made.
